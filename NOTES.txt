Start Bootstrap implementation
    - Start with empty nucleus

Add TestSystem
    - Bootstrapped Store
    - Test Network Implementation
    - Store client
    - Do basic Transaction & Read tests on nucleus



StoragePool
    - port over the full interface
    - Skip the missed update handling for now

Object Allocater Interface
SinglePoolObjectAllocater

Client Allocation Manager
Client Allocation Driver

Basic System Test
    - Allocate objects
    - do transactions on them
    - read results and verify correctness
    - Ensure all allocations, transactions, and Finalization Actions are complete before shutting down
        - Background tasks should be empty as well
            - doh, parallelized tests will share same BG operator
        - Move Background to Server side then have a new one in AmoebaSystem?
            - Could restrict to [client]

FinalizationActions
MissedUpdateErrorHandling
AllocationErrorHandling
    - Fix sweeper bug

FIXME - Sweeper impl can only handle 1 allocation per transaction. Major changes needed to fix this.
FiXME   Will need to include the ObjectId into the TxId

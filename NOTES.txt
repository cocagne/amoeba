FileSystem
    - Create file
        fetchContainingNode from inode table
        Object REvision guard on containing node then set(requireDoesNotExist=true) on inode table
        fetchContainingNode from Directory
        if not exist: set(requireDoesNotExist=true)
        if exists: CreateUnlinkTask, set(keyRevision=Revision)

Unlink is a task.
    - Gurantees exactly once semantics
    - Accurate count on Inode
    - Ensures delete on zero reference

MissedUpdateErrorHandling
AllocationErrorHandling
    - Fix sweeper bug

FIXME - When setting Maximum on KeyValue object, we must check to ensure that no keys exceeding that
        maximum will be present when transaction ends. Must run through adds and deletes to local keys
        to determine this.
   |-> Prevents hole where KV additions are made after a read which results in a split. could leave
       behind keys with value > maximum

FIXME - Sweeper impl can only handle 1 allocation per transaction. Major changes needed to fix this.
FiXME   Will need to include the ObjectId into the TxId

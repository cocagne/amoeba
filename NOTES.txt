Transaction Recovery
    - HB Threshold timeout
    - 1s window for random timeout selection
    - Sleep random time and verify last hb timeout > 1s + sleep time (otherwise someone else won)
    - start driving Tx
    - re-use old driving strategy but update for new interface/threading impl

Next Steps
    - Convert TransactionDriver
        - Convert Unit tests
            - Possibly copy over with minimal changes?

FIXME - Sweeper impl can only handle 1 allocation per transaction. Major changes needed to fix this.
FiXME   Will need to include the ObjectId into the TxId


* Port the flatbuffers encoding.

* Use encoding for TXD on recovery only
    |-> CRL always uses serialized variant (no need to ever use the content, keep serialized)
    |-> Simplifies testing too

* When pruning, add all pruned Tx/Alloc to a separate list
* Then on loop, pull all items from this list before looking at the new items from the concurrent queue
** Allows for easy interleaving between streams and eliminates file size problems

* Port the flatbuffers encoding.

* Use encoding for TXD on recovery only
    |-> CRL always uses serialized variant (no need to ever use the content, keep serialized)
    |-> Simplifies testing too

* When pruning, add all pruned Tx/Alloc to a separate list
* Then on loop, pull all items from this list before looking at the new items from the concurrent queue
** Allows for easy interleaving between streams and eliminates file size problems

Need:
    - TestNetwork
    - Client Side
        - Minimal AmoebaClient
        - Start with Allocation
        - Use concrete classes unless variation is really needed
        - Read Objects
        - TransactionBuilder
            - Allocate objects
            - provide access to owning System

FIXME - Sweeper impl can only handle 1 allocation per transaction. Major changes needed to fix this.
FiXME   Will need to include the ObjectId into the TxId

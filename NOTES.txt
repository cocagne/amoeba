**** Remove extra values from Insert operation

Basic System Tests
    - com.ibm.amoeba package
    - Do basic Transaction & Read tests on nucleus

Object Allocater Interface
    - SinglePoolObjectAllocater
    - Special-case the Nucleus Pool allocater
        - uses single pool allocater
        - constant, zeroed pool id from Nucleus.poolId
        - Special-case this in the getObjectAllocater(poolId: PoolId): Future[ObjectAllocater]
            - all objects use same IDA as nucleus
            - storeIds always use poolId + index

Client Allocation Manager
Client Allocation Driver

    - Allocate a data object and test transactions on it


StoragePool
    - port over the full interface
    - Skip the missed update handling for now





Basic System Test
    - Allocate objects
    - do transactions on them
    - read results and verify correctness
    - Ensure all allocations, transactions, and Finalization Actions are complete before shutting down
        - Background tasks should be empty as well
            - doh, parallelized tests will share same BG operator
        - Move Background to Server side then have a new one in AmoebaSystem?
            - Could restrict to [client]

MissedUpdateErrorHandling
AllocationErrorHandling
    - Fix sweeper bug

FIXME - Sweeper impl can only handle 1 allocation per transaction. Major changes needed to fix this.
FiXME   Will need to include the ObjectId into the TxId

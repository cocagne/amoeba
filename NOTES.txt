Add BootstrapAllocation interface to Store
    - Still needed for bootstrap process
    - Do this directly on Backend rather than store/frontend
        - immediate mode for simplicity
        - precludes bootstrapping over the network but simplifies things greatly

ReadDriver
    - Test algorithm without network (direct injection)
    - Test with using bootstrap alloction directly on stores
        - this also verifies network read

StoragePool
    - port over the full interface
    - Skip the missed update handling for now

Object Allocater Interface
SinglePoolObjectAllocater

Client Allocation Manager
Client Allocation Driver

Basic System Test
    - Allocate objects
    - do transactions on them
    - read results and verify correctness
    - Ensure all allocations, transactions, and Finalization Actions are complete before shutting down
        - Background tasks should be empty as well
            - doh, parallelized tests will share same BG operator
        - Move Background to Server side then have a new one in AmoebaSystem?
            - Could restrict to [client]

MissedUpdateErrorHandling
AllocationErrorHandling
    - Fix sweeper bug

FIXME - Sweeper impl can only handle 1 allocation per transaction. Major changes needed to fix this.
FiXME   Will need to include the ObjectId into the TxId
